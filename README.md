## Description 
In this program you are able to search for films depending on two different peramters. There is a bit of an issue when it comes to looping back when an incorrect option is chosen. Other than that the program works very well and completes the desired task as needed.

## Usage 
What you are able to do in this program is search a mySQL databank, specifically information about films, actors and the language they are shot in. You have two options in which you are able to choose from, option one lets you look up a film by an ID number between and including. 1-1000. Option two allows you to search for films by a custom word search. Enter anything youd like!

## Lessons Learned
This weeks teachings were that reading from a database is releativly easy as long as you know what youre looking for. The only issues that i had this time around were looping issues when it comes to incorrect inputs and correctly formatting my sql search string. It was made apparent to me that the formatting option that works is generally listing desired parameters, listing table where paremeters are FROM, then JOINings of tables, and finally your WHERE in which you search for a specific perameter that then determines what information strings are output.
